# Assignment 7

True/False questions, not to turn in (but you should DO them):

- For every $n > 2$, and any $0< a,b < n$, there is an $x$ such that $ax=b\bmod n$.
- If $x = 0\bmod 11$ and $x = 0\bmod 13$, then it must be that $x = 0$.
- For any prime $p > 2$ there is an $x$ such that $x+x = 1\bmod p$.
- For any prime $p > 2$ there is an $x$ such that $x\cdot x = 1\bmod p$.
- For every prime $p > 2$ there is a solution to the equation $x^2=-1\bmod p$ (i.e. a square root of $-1$ exists).
- There are primes $p > 2$ for which there is a solution to the equation $x^2=-1\bmod p$.
- If $n > 2$ is not prime, there are integers $0 < x < n$ such that no power of $x$ equals $1$.

Questions to turn in:

1. Find all solutions to the equation $12x + 5 = 11\bmod 57$.
2. Which congruence classes modulo $11$ are third powers (i.e. they are equal to $x^3$ for some $x$)?
3. Using our base-26 representation of the english alphabet, encrypt the message "NUMBERSROCK" via the multiplication-by-11 algorithm. Then demonstrate how someone would go about decrypting the message.
4. In $\mathbb{Z}_3$ we want to consider all monic degree-2 polynomials, so all polynomials of the form $x^2+bx+c$ where $b,c\in\mathbb{Z}_3$. There are $3\times 3$ such polynomials. List them, then determine which of those polynomials have "roots" (i.e. values of $x\in\mathbb{Z}_3$ that would make the polynomial equal to $0$), and how many roots they have.
5. Use Fermat's theorem to compute $7^{2015}\bmod 11$.
