# Assignment 1

Make sure to write complete proofs. Try to avoid skipping steps. Write clear sentences.

1. A "multiplicative inverse" for a number $x$ is a number $y$ such that $xy = 1$.
    i. Show that every non-zero rational number has a multiplicative inverse (that is also a rational number). Don't just write $1/x$, the point of this question is to show that "$1/x$" exists. Assume that the rational number is written in the form that rational numbers are, and use that to explicitly write down the inverse.

    ii. If $z$ is a complex number $a + bi$, then we define the *conjugate* $\bar z$ as $\bar z = a - bi$. Show that the product of a complex number with its conjugate is a real number.

    iii. Show that every non-zero complex number has a multiplicative inverse.

2. For this question assume the following for integers, which is the analog of "every integer is odd or even" but using 3 instead of 2 as a factor. We have not proven this assumption, but you may, and will need to, use it. The assumption is: Every integer $n$ can be written in exactly one of the following 3 ways:

    Type A
      ~ In the form $3k$ where $k$ is some integer.

    Type B
      ~ In the form $3k+1$ where $k$ is some integer.

    Type C
      ~ In the form $3k+2$ where $k$ is some integer.

    Answer the following questions:
    i. Show that if $n$ is of type C, then $2n$ is of type B.
    ANSWERSPACE
    ii. Show that if $m$ is of type A and $n$ is any integer, then $mn$ is also of type A.
    ANSWERSPACE
    iii. Show that if $n$ is an integer, then $n^2$ cannot be of type C.

    iv. Show that for any integer $n$, the product $(2n+1)(n+1)n$ is of type A.
