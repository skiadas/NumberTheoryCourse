# Assignment 4

Make sure to write complete proofs. Try to avoid skipping steps. Write clear sentences.

1. True or False: If $p,q$ are prime, then $\gcd(p,q)$ is equal to either $p$ or $q$.
2. Show that if $p > 3$ is a prime number then the remainder of diving $p$ by $6$ is either $1$ or $5$. Provide examples to show that both remainders are indeed possible.
3. Suppose that $M$ is a number that is relatively prime to $6$ and is also a perfect square (i.e. it is $M=n^2$ of some integer $n$). Show that $M$ divided by $6$ leaves remainder $1$.
4. Suppose that $M$ is a perfect square. Show that its remainder when divided by $4$ must be $0$ or $1$.
5. Use the previous problem to show that the number $1403$ cannot possibly be the sum of two perfect squares.
