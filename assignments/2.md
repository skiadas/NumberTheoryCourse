# Assignment 2

Make sure to write complete proofs. Try to avoid skipping steps. Write clear sentences.

1. For each of the following statements, if the statement is true then say so and provide a proof. If it is false then say so and provide an example/proof. All variables involved are supposed to be natural numbers.
    i. For all n and m, if $n+m$ is odd then exactly one of n,m is odd.

4. Let $F_n$ be the $n$-th Fibonacci number, starting with $F_0=0$ and $F_1=1$ (and so $F_2=1$). First verify numerically by examining the first 6 cases, and then prove by mathematical induction, that for every $n\geq 1$ we have the formula: $$F_1^2 + F_2^2 +\cdots + F_n^2 = F_n F_{n+1}$$

5. The Lucas numbers are generated by starting with $L_0 = 2$, $L_1=1$ and for each subsequent $n$ we have $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$. So same recursive relation as the Fibonacci numbers, but different starting numbers. Compute the first 10 Lucas numbers. Prove by mathematical induction that the Lucas numbers and the Fibonacci numbers have the relation $L_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n+1}$, for $n\geq 1$.
