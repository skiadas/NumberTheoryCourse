# Assignment 6

1. Using the fact that $4\times 15 = 60$, solve the equation $15x + 12 \equiv 3\bmod 59$. Your solution should be a number $x$ computed "modulo 59". It should be an integer between 0 and 58.
2. Find the first power of $3$ that is congruent to 1 modulo 11, and use this information to find out the value of $3^{2014}\bmod 11$.
3. True or False: If $n$ is a composite, then there are $x,y$ such that $x\not\equiv 0\bmod n$ and $y\not\equiv 0\bmod n$ but $xy\equiv 0\bmod n$.
4. True or False: For every prime $p > 3$ the equation $x^2 + 1\equiv 0\bmod p$ has a solution.
5. Find an $x$ such that $x = 10\bmod 13$ and $x = 5\bmod 59$.
