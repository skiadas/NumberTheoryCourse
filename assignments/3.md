1. True or False? Every natural number is either prime or composite.
2. Find all common divisors of the numbers $365$ and $219$.
3. True or False? For every $a,b,c > 1$ natural numbers, if $a$ divides $b+c$ then it must divide $b$ or $c$ (or maybe both, but it has to divide at least one of them). Prove or provide counter-example.
4. True or False? The sum of two composite numbers is composite. Explain.
5. True or False? The sum of two prime numbers is never prime. Explain.
