# Assignment 5

Make sure to write complete proofs. Try to avoid skipping steps. Write clear sentences.

1. True or False: If the remainder of doing Euclidean Division of a by c is r, i.e. if $a=qc + r$ with certain conditions on r, and the remainder of doing Euclidean Division of b by c is s, then the remainder of doing Euclidean Division of $a+b$ by c is $r+s$. Prove or provide counter-example.
2. True or False: If $\gcd(a,b) = 1$ and $\gcd(a,c) = 1$, then $\gcd(a, bc) = 1$. Prove or provide counter-example.
3. Using the Euclidean algorithm, find concrete numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $245x + 356y = 1$.
4. True or False: For given $a, b$, if we can solve $ax+by = c$, then we can also solve $ax+by = d$ for any $d\geq c$. Prove or provide counter-example.
5. True or False: The equation $2x+by=c$ has a solution for all $c$ if and only if $b$ is an odd number. Prove or provide counter-example.
