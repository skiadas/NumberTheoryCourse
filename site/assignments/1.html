<p>Make sure to write complete proofs. Try to avoid skipping steps. Write clear sentences.</p>

<li>A &quot;multiplicative inverse&quot; for a number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is a number <span class="math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(xy = 1\)</span>.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Show that every non-zero rational number has a multiplicative inverse (that is also a rational number).  </li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(z\)</span> is a complex number <span class="math">\(a + bi\)</span>, then we define the <em>conjugate</em> <span class="math">\(\bar z\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\bar z = a - bi\)</span>. Show that the product of a complex number with its conjugate is a real number.  </li>
<li>Show that every non-zero complex number has a multiplicative inverse.  </li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For this question assume the following for integeres, which is the analog of &quot;every integer is odd or even&quot; but using 3 instead of 2 as a factor. We have not proven this assumption, but you may, and will need to, use it. The assumption is: Every integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span> can be written in exactly one of the following 3 ways:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Type A</dt>
<dd>In the form <span class="math">\(3k\)</span> where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is some integer.
</dd>
<dt>Type B</dt>
<dd>In the form <span class="math">\(3k+1\)</span> where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is some integer.
</dd>
<dt>Type C</dt>
<dd>In the form <span class="math">\(3k+2\)</span> where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is some integer.
</dd>
</dl>
Answer the following questions:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is of type C, then <span class="math">\(2n\)</span> is of type B.  </li>
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is of type A and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is any integer, then <span class="math">\(mn\)</span> is also of type A.  </li>
<li>Show that if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is an integer, then <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span> cannot be of type C.    </li>
<li>Show that for any integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the product <span class="math">\((2n+1)(n+1)n\)</span> is of type A.    </li>
