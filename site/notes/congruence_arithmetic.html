<p>One of the most powerful facts about congruence relations is that they respect arithmetic operations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a \equiv b \bmod n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c \equiv d \bmod n\)</span> then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[a + c \equiv b + d \bmod n\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ac \equiv bd \bmod n\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[a^k \equiv b^k \bmod n\]</span> for all <span class="math">\(k\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has many far-reaching consequences, that we will examine in due course.</p>
<p>The proof of these two statements is fairly straighforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math">\(n|(b-a)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n|(d-c)\)</span>, then it also is the case that <span class="math">\(n|(b-a+d-c) = b+d- (a+c)\)</span>.</li>
<li>For the second assertion:
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math">\(n|(b-a)\)</span> then it also divides <span class="math">\(db-da\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(n|(d-c)\)</span> then it also divides <span class="math">\(ad-ac\)</span>.</li>
<li>Therefore it divides <span class="math">\(db - da + ad - ac = bd - ac\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The third assertion follows by induction and using the second assertion.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a simple example, we can easily reduce a complex computation if can reduce its individual parts first. For instance, if we want to compute &quot;mod 10&quot;, then we are effectively talking about keeping only the ones digit from the number. So for instance we can do:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[45322 \times 343523 \times 34519 \equiv 2\times 3 \times 9 \equiv 54 \equiv 4\bmod 10\]</span></p>
<p>As another example, let us try to compute <span class="math">\(2^{10}\bmod 5\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[2^3 = 8 \equiv 3 \bmod 5\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[2^4 = 8 \times 2 = 3\times 2 = 6 \equiv 1 \bmod 5\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[2^8 = 2^4 \times 2^4 \equiv 1\times 1 = 1\bmod 5\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[2^{10} = 2^8 \times 2^2 \equiv 1 \times 4 = 4\bmod 5\]</span></p>
<p>In fact we can efficiently compute powers with very large exponents very efficiently, if we work modulo a number. Think of how we could get to <span class="math">\(2^{100}\)</span> modulo 5, as well as <span class="math">\(3^{100}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(4^{100}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This technique can give rise to some really nice divisibility tests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A number is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9.</p>
<p>Consequently a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is.</p>
<p>A number is congruent to the alternating sum of its digits modulo 11.</p>
<p>Consequently a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, 3412458 is divisible by <span class="math">\(9\)</span> since <span class="math">\(8+5+4+2+1+4+3 = 27\)</span>. It is not divisible by <span class="math">\(11\)</span> since <span class="math">\(8-5+4-2+1-4+3 = 5\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: Can we have two numbers that are not <span class="math">\(\equiv 0\mod n\)</span> but whose product is <span class="math">\(\equiv 0\mod n\)</span>?</p>
