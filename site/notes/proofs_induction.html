<h1 id="the-principle-of-mathematical-induction">The Principle of Mathematical Induction</h1>
<p>We discuss here the Principle of Mathematical Induction, usually simply called &quot;Induction&quot;, which is a fundamental technique for proving statements about all natural numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The principle of induction says the following: In order to prove a statement <span class="math">\(P(n)\)</span> for all natural numbers <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, it is enough to prove the following two statements:</p>
<dl>
<dt>base case</dt>
<dd><span class="math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true
</dd>
<dt>inductive step</dt>
<dd>If <span class="math">\(P(k)\)</span> was true for some particular <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> would also have to be true.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>This is helpful because we no longer have to prove things for all natural numbers directly. We just need one special case, <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and then under the assumption that <span class="math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true we have to be able to &quot;move to the next step&quot;. Being able to assume <span class="math">\(P(k)\)</span> to be true while trying to prove <span class="math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is very powerful.</li>
<li>The motivation behind this principle, is that since we can reach every natural number by starting from <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and just adding <span class="math">\(1\)</span> over and over again, the two statements above would allow us to reach any <span class="math">\(P(n)\)</span> we like (though it may take a while to write it out if we have to say make it to <span class="math">\(P(100000)\)</span>).</li>
<li>Induction effectively allows us to say: &quot;<span class="math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true, so <span class="math">\(P(2)\)</span> is true, so <span class="math">\(P(3)\)</span> is true, so ... so <span class="math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true&quot;</li>
<li>The book has a number of nice examples, you should read them. We will do a slightly different example here. We will use induction to prove the statement <span class="math">\(P(n)\)</span> for all natural numbers, where <span class="math">\(P(n)=\)</span>&quot;<span class="math">\(n\)</span> is either even or odd&quot;. So we will effectively be proving that every natural number is either even or odd.
<ul>
<li>Base case: <span class="math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true, since <span class="math">\(1\)</span> is in fact an odd number, as it is <span class="math">\(2\times 0 + 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Inductive case: Suppose <span class="math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true, so <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is either even or odd.
<ul>
<li>We need to show that <span class="math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is also true.</li>
<li>In other words we need to show that <span class="math">\(k+1\)</span> is either even or odd.</li>
<li>We take cases on <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is even, then <span class="math">\(k = 2i\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(k+1=2i+1\)</span> is odd.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math">\(k=2i+1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k+1=2i+1+1=2i+2=2(i+1)\)</span> is even.</li>
<li>So in either case, <span class="math">\(k+1\)</span> is either odd or even. This proves the inductive step.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The principle of induction now tells us that the statement must be true for all natural numbers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As practice: Prove that every natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is greater than or equal to 1.</li>
<li><p>Food for thought: Why can't we use induction to prove things for all real numbers? Why isn't the same principle true for all real numbers?</p></li>
</ul>
