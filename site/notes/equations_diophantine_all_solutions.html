<p>Now that we know how to find one solution, the question naturally arises if we can find more, preferably if we can find them all.</p>
<p>Let us think about this for a minute. Suppose we did have another solution, so:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ax_1 + by_1 = c = ax_2 + by_2\]</span></p>
<p>Then we should be able to say:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[a(x_1-x_2) = b(y_2-y_1)\]</span></p>
<p>So there is some relation between these solutions and a <em>common multiple</em> of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. Let's make it more precise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(ax_1 + by_1 = c\)</span> is a solution.</p>
<p>Then every other solution can be obtained as</p>
<p><span class="math">\[x_2 = x_1 - k_1, \quad y_2 = y_1 + k_2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\((k_1, k_2)\)</span> are such that <span class="math">\(ak_1 = bk_2\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is easy to see. So the solutions to the diophantine equations are in 1-1 correspondence with these pairs of numbers.</p>
<p>Before we see the main theorem, let us have some definitions and a key result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(d=\gcd(a,b)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m=lcm(a,b)\)</span>. Further let <span class="math">\(a&#39;d = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b&#39;d = b\)</span>. Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(a&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b&#39;\)</span> are relatively prime.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(a&#39;b = ab&#39; = m\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(dm = ab\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To see this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any common factor of <span class="math">\(a&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b&#39;\)</span> would, when multiplied by <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, provide a common divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the largest such divisor, so that common factor can only be 1. So <span class="math">\(a&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b&#39;\)</span> must be relatively prime.</li>
<li>The other two parts say the same thing, so we only need to show one of them. We will show the last one, that <span class="math">\(dm = ab\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>First, notice that <span class="math">\(\frac{ab}{d}\)</span> is an integer that is a common multiple of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\(\frac{ab}{d}\geq m\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(ab\geq md\)</span>.</li>
<li>Second, notice that since <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the gcd we can write <span class="math">\(d = ax + by\)</span>. Multiplying by <span class="math">\(m\)</span> gives us: <span class="math">\(md = amx + bmy\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and also a mupltiple of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, it follows that the two terms in the right hand side are both multiples of <span class="math">\(ab\)</span>.</li>
<li>So that equation becomes <span class="math">\(md = K \times ab\)</span>. But this says <span class="math">\(md\geq ab\)</span>.</li>
<li>Hence <span class="math">\(md = ab\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the main theorem that tells us how to find other solutions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(a x_1 + b y_1 = c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b&#39;\)</span> are as above.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math">\(a (x_1 - kb&#39;) + b (y_1 + ka&#39;) = c\)</span> for all integers <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, all solutions to <span class="math">\(ax+by = c\)</span> have this form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have already seen that other solutions <span class="math">\((x_2,y_2)\)</span> have to relate to the original <span class="math">\((x_1,y_1)\)</span> via:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[x_1 - x_2 = k_1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_2 - y_1 = k_2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(k_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k_2\)</span> are such that</p>
<span class="math">\[ak_1 = bk_2\]</span></li>
<li><p>All we need to do now is find all such pairs <span class="math">\((k_1, k_2)\)</span>. This will be done in the next theorem.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(d=\gcd(a,b)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b&#39;\)</span> are as before.</p>
<p>Then for any pair <span class="math">\((k_1, k_2)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(ak_1 = bk_2\)</span> there is an integer <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math">\[k_1 = k b&#39;,\quad k_2 = k a&#39;\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us prove this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, note that numbers <span class="math">\((k_1,k_2)\)</span> that have this form <span class="math">\((kb&#39;,ka&#39;)\)</span> do satisfy the needed equation <span class="math">\(ak_1=bk_2\)</span>. So this does in fact give us all such pairs of numbers.</li>
<li>For proving the other direction, suppose <span class="math">\(ak_1 = bk_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>This number is a common multiple of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, so must be equal to <span class="math">\(mk\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</li>
<li>Then <span class="math">\(ak_1=mk\)</span>, <span class="math">\(bk_2 = mk\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since <span class="math">\(b&#39; = m/a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a&#39; = m/b\)</span>, we see that <span class="math">\(k_1 = b&#39;k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k_2=a&#39;k\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Random property of the gcd that is worth mentioning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b | ac\)</span>, then it must be the case that <span class="math">\(b|c\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prove this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with the equation <span class="math">\(ax+by=1\)</span>, which we know must have a solution since <span class="math">\(a,b\)</span> are relatively prime.</li>
<li>We multiply both sides by <span class="math">\(c\)</span>. We then get <span class="math">\(acx + bcx = c\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since <span class="math">\(b\)</span> divides both terms on the left side, it must also divide the right hand side <span class="math">\(c\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
