<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The main result in this section is the <strong>Division Theorem</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any natural <span class="math">\(a\in\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>, there are unique integers <span class="math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(0\leq r &lt; b\)</span> and:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[a = qb + r\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intuitive idea is that we add together as many <span class="math">\(b\)</span>'s as we can before we reach <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Then whatever remains cannot have any more <span class="math">\(b\)</span>'s in it, and it will serve as our <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we look at the proof, let us look at some consequences of the theorem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that every integers is odd or even follows directly, by using <span class="math">\(b=2\)</span>.</li>
<li>The fact from your homework that every integer was in one of the types A, B, C follows directly, by using <span class="math">\(b=3\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical proof:</p>
<p>The proof has two distinct parts. First we prove that there are <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math">\(r\)</span> satisfying the requirements. Then we will prove that they are unique.</p>
<p>Proof that they exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider the set:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[S = \{ a - xb \mid x\in\mathbb{Z}, a-xb \geq 0 \}\]</span></p></li>
<li>This set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is always non-empty (WHY?).</li>
<li>By the Well-Ordering principle, there must be a smallest element, so there is some <span class="math">\(x=q\)</span> that achieves this smallest element in S.</li>
<li>Define <span class="math">\(r = a-qb\)</span>, which is this smallest element in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</li>
<li>Then first of all <span class="math">\(r\geq 0\)</span>.</li>
<li>All that is left is to show that <span class="math">\(r &lt; b\)</span>. We proceed by contradiction.
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math">\(r &gt;= b\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(r-b\geq 0\)</span>.</li>
<li>And <span class="math">\(r - b = a - (q+1)b\)</span>.</li>
<li>So <span class="math">\(r - b\)</span> is a number in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, and it's smaller that <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, which is a contradiction.</li>
<li>So it must be the case that <span class="math">\(r &lt; b\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Essentially the Well-Ordering principle captures the idea to &quot;use as many <span class="math">\(b\)</span>'s as you can fit&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Proof that they are unique:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a simpler contradiction proof. Suppose that we had two ways, so:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[a = bq + r = bq&#39; + r&#39;\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>We can rewrite this as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[b(q-q&#39;) = r&#39; - r\]</span></p></li>
<li>Now this equation has on the left side the product of <span class="math">\(b\)</span> with an integer. So unless that integer is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, this product will be either at least <span class="math">\(b\)</span> or at most <span class="math">\(-b\)</span>.</li>
<li><p>On the right side it has the difference of two numbers that are <span class="math">\(\geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(&lt;b\)</span>. So this difference must be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[-b &lt; r&#39; - r &lt; b\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>So the only way they can equal each other is if they are both <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. But then <span class="math">\(q=q&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r=r&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We call <span class="math">\(r\)</span> the <em>remainder</em>, and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> the <em>quotient</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(b\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(a\)</span> if and only if the remainder of dividing <span class="math">\(a\)</span> by <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fairly straightforward to see.</p>
<p>Here is one nice consequence of the division theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a|x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b|x\)</span>, then their least common multiple <span class="math">\(lcm(a,b)|x\)</span> also must divide <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prove this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define <span class="math">\(M = lcm(a,b)\)</span>. We will need to show that <span class="math">\(M|x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Start by doing the division <span class="math">\(x = qM + r\)</span> where <span class="math">\(0\leq r &lt; M\)</span>.</li>
<li>It will be enough to show that <span class="math">\(r=0\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since <span class="math">\(a|M\)</span>, we can write <span class="math">\(M = ad\)</span>.</li>
<li>So <span class="math">\(x = qda + r\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>Question: why is that not enough to say that <span class="math">\(r=0\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(a|x\)</span>?</li>
<li>Make sure to answer this question before proceeding to the next line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It must be the case that <span class="math">\(a|r\)</span>, since it divides both <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(qda\)</span>.</li>
<li>With a similar reasoning, <span class="math">\(b|r\)</span>.</li>
<li>So <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is a common multiple of both <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, so it must be <span class="math">\(\geq M\)</span>. Contradiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important theorem relates to the greatest common divisor:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)\)</span> is an integer linear combination of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li>In fact it is the smallest positive number that is an integer linear combination of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(d|a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d|b\)</span>, then we also have that <span class="math">\(d|\gcd(a,b)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To see this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1:
<ul>
<li>This will follow as a byproduct of part 2.</li>
<li>We will also prove it independently later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Part 2:
<ul>
<li><p>We start with the set</p>
<p><span class="math">\[S = \{ax+by \mid ax+by &gt; 0, x,y\in\mathbb{Z} \}\]</span></p></li>
<li>This is a nonempty set (WHY?).</li>
<li>So <span class="math">\(S\)</span> must have a smallest element, call it <span class="math">\(D = ax + by\)</span>.</li>
<li>We have seen that any divisor of both <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> must divide their linear combinations.</li>
<li>So it must be the case that <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)|D\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)\leq D\)</span>.</li>
<li>We will now show that <span class="math">\(D\)</span> must divide <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and consequently must also divide <span class="math">\(b\)</span> by symmetry.
<ul>
<li>Let us divide <span class="math">\(D\)</span> into <span class="math">\(a\)</span>: <span class="math">\(a = Dm + r\)</span> where <span class="math">\(0\leq r &lt; D\)</span>.</li>
<li>The key observation is that <span class="math">\(D-r\)</span> is also in the set <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</li>
<li>This is because <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li>But this contradicts the choice of <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, so it must be the case that <span class="math">\(r = 0\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(D|a\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since <span class="math">\(D\)</span> divides both <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> it must be no more than the gcd.</li>
<li>So <span class="math">\(D\leq \gcd(a,b)\)</span>.</li>
<li>So it must be the case that <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b) = D\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Part 3:
<ul>
<li>A divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> also divides any linear combination of them.</li>
<li>The <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)\)</span> is a linear combination.</li>
<li>Therefore any divisor of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> also divides <span class="math">\(\gcd(a,b)\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
