<p>We saw that if we consider the congruence classes modulo <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, there are exactly <span class="math">\(n\)</span> of them, represented by the remainders when dividing by <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. We will denote them thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbb{Z}_n = \bar 0, \bar 1, \ldots, \overline{n-1}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea takes some getting used to: Each of these &quot;barred numbers&quot; represents a whole set of numbers, namely all elements in that congruence class. Yet we want to think of that entire set as &quot;one number&quot;.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that we can now define arithmetic operations on this set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We define the &quot;sum&quot; and &quot;product&quot; of two congruence classes, as the congruence class of the sum/product of representatives of those classes. In other words:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\bar a + \bar b = \overline{a+b}\]</span> <span class="math">\[\bar a \cdot \bar b = \overline{a \cdot b}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must show that this is actually <em>well-defined</em>: What if we choose a different <span class="math">\(a\)</span> to present the class <span class="math">\(\bar a\)</span>? Could that possibly change the result?</p>
<p>The fact that these operations are well-defined follows from our previous result for how congruences behave under addition and multiplication. Recall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a\equiv c \bmod n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\equiv d \bmod n\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(a+b \equiv c+d\bmod n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a\cdot b \equiv c\cdot d\bmod n\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This says exactly what we need: Congruent input values give us congruent results. So changing the representative does not change the congruence class of the result.</p>
<p>As a quick example, suppose we work modulo <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(\bar 2 + \bar 4 = \bar 6 = \bar 1\)</span>. If we choose different representatives, we would get the same result: <span class="math">\(\bar 7 + \bar 4 = \bar 11 = \bar 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is an important general idea to keep in mind, when we want to define operations like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We want to define something that should make sense as an operation on an entire set (like a congruence class in this example).</li>
<li>To do that, we pick an arbitrary representative from the set, and use that specific element to define the operation.</li>
<li>We then show that the result does not depend on the choice of representative.</li>
<li>We then can say that the operation is <em>well-defined</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will denote this system of congruence classes modulo n with <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span>, and call it a <strong>finite number system</strong>. There is one such system for every <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>These finite number systems retain many of the familiar properties. Consider each of the following questions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is addition commutative?</li>
<li>Is addition associative?</li>
<li>Is there an identity for addition? (similar to the &quot;zero&quot;)</li>
<li>Does every element have an additive inverse?</li>
<li>Is multiplication commutative?</li>
<li>Is multiplication associative?</li>
<li>Is there an identity for multiplication? (similar to the &quot;one&quot;)</li>
<li>Does multiplication distribute over addition?</li>
<li>Does every element have a multiplicative inverse?</li>
<li>Can I cancel out the same number if present on both sides of an equation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Properties 1-8 together are the definition of what we would call a <strong>ring</strong>. So we can say that <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span> has a ring structure.</p>
