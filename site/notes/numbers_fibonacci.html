<ul>
<li>The Fibonacci numbers are a well known sequence of numbers, defined via a recursion:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(F_1 = 1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(F_2 = 1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\)</span> for every <span class="math">\(n \geq 2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>In other words, every subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.</li>
<li>Student TODO: Compute the next 8 terms.</li>
<li>Student TODO: Compute successive sums:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(F_1 + F_2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(F_1 + F_2 + F_3\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + F_4\)</span></li>
<li>Do you notice a pattern in how those number relate, to the Fibonacci sequence perhaps?</li>
<li>Together TODO: Prove our guess using induction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Fibonacci numbers have a close relation to the &quot;golden ratio&quot;, which is equal to <span class="math">\(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\)</span> and is denoted by <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span>.</li>
<li>The golden ratio is the positive solution to the equation <span class="math">\(x^2 = x + 1\)</span> which can also be written as <span class="math">\(x = 1 + \frac{1}{x}\)</span>.</li>
<li><p>In fact it turns out that the golden ratio equals the limit of the ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\varphi=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}\]</span></p></li>
<li>Try the first couple of quotients by hand.</li>
<li><p>We now will discuss the following wonderful theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every natural number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> can be written as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First off, try some numbers and convince yourselves that you can write them.</li>
<li>Here is a sketch of a proof:
<ul>
<li>Take the largest Fibonacci number that is not bigger than <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, say it is <span class="math">\(F_k\)</span>.</li>
<li>Look at <span class="math">\(n - F_k\)</span>. By induction, we can assume that this number can be written as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, say <span class="math">\(n - F_k = F_a + F_b + F_c + ...\)</span>.</li>
<li>Moving <span class="math">\(F_k\)</span> to the other side would do it, provided there isn't an <span class="math">\(F_k\)</span> there already.</li>
<li>But we can show that <span class="math">\(n - F_k &lt; F_{k-1}\)</span> (THINK ABOUT IT!), so in fact the Fibonacci numbers used to write <span class="math">\(n - F_k\)</span> cannot include <span class="math">\(F_{k-1}\)</span> nor anything bigger (e.g. not <span class="math">\(F_k\)</span> either).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Food for thought: We can always assume that the Fibonacci numbers we use are non-consecutive. Why?</li>
<li><p>In fact with that extra assumption, there is a uniqueness component:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every number can be written as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers in a unique way.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
