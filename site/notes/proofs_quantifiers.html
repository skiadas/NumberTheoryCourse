<h1 id="quantifiers-and-proofs">Quantifiers and Proofs</h1>
<p>We discuss in this section how quantifiers are used, and how they affect the proving process.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are two quantifiers:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math">\(\forall\)</span></dt>
<dd>&quot;for all&quot;. Called the <strong>universal quantifier</strong>.
</dd>
<dt><span class="math">\(\exists\)</span></dt>
<dd>&quot;exists&quot;. Called the <strong>existential quantifier</strong>.
</dd>
</dl>
They are followed by a variable, and they are meant to suggest that the remaining statement is true for all values (respectively for at least one value).</li>
<li>In every theorem or lemma, any variable needs to be quantified. If it is not, it is implicitly assumed that &quot;forall&quot; was intended.</li>
<li>To prove a statement &quot;for every integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span>&quot;:
<ul>
<li>Say &quot;let <span class="math">\(n\)</span> be an integer&quot;. <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is now a specific, fixed, but unknown number. It stands as a &quot;placeholder&quot; for any arbitrary number.</li>
<li>Continue with the proof.</li>
<li>If you end up proving the statement for this <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and since it could be absolutely any number, you have proven it for all numbers.</li>
<li>NOTE: the word &quot;let&quot; is also used to introduce new intermediate variables that we define to help us along.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To prove a statement &quot;there exists an integer <span class="math">\(n\)</span> such that ...&quot;
<ul>
<li>The simplest approach is to in fact demonstrate a specific number <span class="math">\(n\)</span> that has the property. A single example suffices, even if there might be many numbers that have the property.</li>
<li>Some times you can prove by contradiction:
<ul>
<li>Assume the &quot;there exists an integer such that ...&quot; statement is false. Then it must be the case that for all integers <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, whatever is in the &quot;...&quot; has to be false.</li>
<li>So we end up instead assuming a statement that says &quot;for all integers <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, ... is false&quot;.</li>
<li>If we can prove that this somehow produces a contradiction, that means there must be an integer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One subtle point however. Here is what you should NOT do: Say we want to show that &quot;there exists an integer n that is even&quot;.
<ul>
<li>Assume by contradiction that all integers are not even.</li>
<li>But for example 4 is in fact even. Contradiction.</li>
<li>Therefore our assumption that all integers are not even must be false. So there must be an integer that is even.</li>
<li>Can you spot why this reasoning is to be avoided?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Order of quantifiers matters. Consider the following two statements:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math">\(\forall x\exists y\, x+y &gt; 0\)</span></dt>
<dd>This is true (why?)
</dd>
<dt><span class="math">\(\exists y\forall x\, x+y &gt; 0\)</span></dt>
<dd>This is false (why?)
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Negating quantified statements ends up switching the quantifiers:
<ul>
<li>The negation of &quot;<span class="math">\(\forall n\,P(n)\)</span>&quot; is &quot;<span class="math">\(\exists n\, \text{not} P(n)\)</span>&quot;</li>
<li>The negation of &quot;<span class="math">\(\exists n\,P(n)\)</span>&quot; is &quot;<span class="math">\(\forall n\, \text{not} P(n)\)</span>&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
