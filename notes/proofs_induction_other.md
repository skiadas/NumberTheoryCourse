## Notes

We will very briefly cover the Well-Ordering Principle and what is known as "strong induction". For now, we just want you to be aware of their existence.

- In normal induction, we:
    - Prove our statement when $n = 1$
    - Prove that if the statement is true when $n = k$, it must also be true when $n=k+1$
- In **strong induction**:
    - Prove our statement when $n = 1$
    - Prove that if the statement is true for all $n = 1,2,3,...,k$, then it must be true for $k+1$ also.
- In other words, we assume all previous statements are true, not just the one right before the one we are working on.
- The **Well-Ordering Principle** says the following:

    > Every non-empty subset of the natural numbers must have a smallest element

    We will see examples of this principle as we move along.
