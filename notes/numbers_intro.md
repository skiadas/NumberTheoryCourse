## Notes

First a short survey of number systems.

- We all know the *natural numbers*: 1, 2, 3, 4, ... Start from 1, and add it into itself over and over. These will be the main focus of this course.
- By including a zero and additive inverses, we get *negative integers*: -1, -2, 0
- By taking quotients of those we form *rational numbers*: $2/3$, $-42/11$
- In Calculus we learn about the *real numbers*: $e$, $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$
- One of the fundamental results is that there are many real numbers that are not rational (*irrational numbers*). In fact almost every real number is not rational.
- *Complex numbers* have the form: $a + bi$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ represents a "square root of -1". They are an extension of the reals.
    - We can define addition and multiplication of complex numbers by extending the properties for reals.
    - There is a zero, $0 + 0i$.
    - Cool fact: Every polynomial equation has solutions in the complex numbers. For example $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has solutions $i$ and $-i$.
- There is a special subset of the complex numbers, called *Gaussian integers*. These consist of all complex numbers $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are both integers.
- The standard number systems:

    $\mathbb{N}$
      ~ The natural numbers: $\mathbb{N} = \{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$

    $\mathbb{Z}$
      ~ The integers:  $\mathbb{Z} = \{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$

    $\mathbb{Q}$
      ~ The rational numbers: $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{a}{b} \mid a, b\in \mathbb{Z}, b\neq 0 \right\}$

    $\mathbb{R}$
      ~ The real numbers. Precisely defining them is more difficult.

    $\mathbb{C}$
      ~ The complex numbers: $\mathbb{C} = \{ a + bi \mid a, b\in\mathbb{R} \}$
