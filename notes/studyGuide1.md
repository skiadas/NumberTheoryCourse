## Material covered

Up to and including chapter 6.

- Definitions to know:
    - Divisibility
    - gcd and lcm
    - prime and composite numbers
- You should know all theorem and lemma statements. Especially:
    - Well-ordering principle
    - Every number is a product of primes
    - Euclidean division
    - Euclidean algorithm
    - gcd is the smallest integer linear combination of the terms
    - Every number is a product of primes in a unique way (up to order of factors)
    - lcm divides all other common multiples
    - Applications of Fundamental Theorem
- Theorems you should know how to prove:
    - Sketch the idea of why every number is a product of primes
    - Prove that the gcd is the last non-zero remainder in the euclidean algorithm
    - Prove that lcm(a, b) divides all other common multiples of a, b
    - Prove the condition about when a diophantine equation $ax+by=c$ has a solution.

## Practice Problems
