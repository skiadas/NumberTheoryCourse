# Midterm 2 Study Guide

## Material covered

Chapters 7 through 9, and 10.1.

- Definitions to know:
    - What it means for two numbers to be congruent modulo $n$. This has 3-4 variations.
    - Congruence classes.
    - How we define addition and multiplication for congruence classes.
    - The notions of ring, integral domain, field.
    - "reduced residues".
    - Euler's $\phi$ function.
    - Order of an element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$
- You should know all theorem and lemma statements. Especially:
    - Two numbers are congruent modulo $n$ if and only if they have the same remainder when divided by $n$.
    - Addition and multiplication are well defined for congruence classes.
    - Chinese Remainder Theorem (versions 7.4.1 and 7.4.2).
    - $\mathbb{Z}_n$ forms a ring.
    - Equivalent conditions for congruence (8.2.4).
    - Which elements mod n have multiplicative inverses.
    - The only solutions to $x^2 = 1\bmod n$ are $\pm 1$.
    - Wilson's theorem.
    - Formulas for computing $\phi(n)$.
    - Fermat's Little Theorem.
    - Euler's Theorem.
    - Encryption/Decryption via exponentiation (9.4.1).
    - Public Key Cryptography and RSA.
    - Order of elements modulo $p$ divides $p-1$.
    - Order of a power of an element divides order of the element.
- Theorems you should know how to prove:
    - Why addition and multiplication are well-defined operations for congruence classes.
    - Why congruence is an equivalence relation.
    - A finite integral domain is necessarily a field.
    - $\mathbb{Z}_n$ has zero-divisors if and only if $n$ is prime if and only if $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a field.
    - Every invertible element is cancellable. (Also show by example the converse is not in general true)
    - Fermat's Little Theorem.
    - Order of a power of an element divides order of the element.

## Practice Problems

- Know very well all the turned-in assignments (6-8)

- Be ready for true/false questions
- Know how to compute multiplicative inverses using the Euclidean algorithm for the gcd.
- Know how to compute the common solution to a Chinese Remainder Theorem situation.
- Know how to encrypt/decrypt via addition/multiplication modulo $26$.
- Know how to perform fast exponentiation.
